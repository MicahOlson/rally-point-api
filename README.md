## Project Proposal
### Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
This is an application for organizations and their members to manage emergency or similar disruption events by allowing organizers to post response and/or continuity plans, communicate alerts and updates for events to members, and provide a check-in process during events for all users to directly share their status as an alternative to the more antiquated call-tree process.

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
* A database to store information for the organization, users, event posts, and response plans
* Full CRUD functionality for organizers to manage their organization, members, and events
* Limited RU functionality for members to update their own account details (e.g., contact info, status)
* Authentication and role authorization to limit access of organizers and members solely to their own organization, and members solely to main organization pages and their own accounts
* A UI for users to log in, see or post events depending on role, access or post response plans depending on role, and check-in with their status

### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
* Ruby
* Rails
* ERB/HTML
* CSS/SASS
* PostgreSQL

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
* Improve styling and add responsive design for mobile
* Alert users via email and/or text when a new event has been posted for their organization
* Display a dynamic geographical map to direct members to physical rally points when appropriate
* Feed local disruption event information to organization pages from an API
* Add many-to-many relationship from many members to many organizations
* Add multiple sites/locations option for organizations, and additional authorization limits to members for these locales
* React front-end

### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
* Flexbox and/or Bootstrap
* Rails Action Mailer
* Google Maps (embedded)
* Possible disruption event API being researched
* React, Redux
